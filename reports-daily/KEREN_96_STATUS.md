## 🏆 MAJOR MILESTONE: 96/100 TASKS DONE

### ✅ Task 53 Just Completed (25 minutes)
**Jerusalem/Kotel Background Elements**

**What Was Implemented:**
1. Created `jerusalem-skyline.svg` - Minimalist Old City silhouette
   - Kotel stone blocks, Dome of the Rock, Tower of David
   - Subtle cream/gold colors (#d4c5b0, #daa520)
   
2. Created `kotel-texture.svg` - Repeating stone pattern
   - Jerusalem limestone aesthetic
   - Ultra-subtle overlay

3. Integrated into Hero Section:
   - Skyline: 40% opacity, bottom-positioned
   - Texture: 3% opacity, repeated overlay
   - Both aria-hidden, non-intrusive

**Design Philosophy:**
✓ Conservative (matches clean aesthetic)
✓ Authentic (real Jerusalem architecture)
✓ Subtle (enhancement, not distraction)
✓ Respectful (appropriate for holy sites)

**Build:** ✅ Successful (4.47s, no errors)
**Pushed:** ✅ GitHub commit 105f1d6

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

### Option A: Ship Now (RECOMMENDED)
- **96% complete** is production-ready
- All critical features working
- Remaining 4 tasks are enhancements
- Client can test and provide feedback
- We implement Task 86 + AI images based on priorities

### Option B: Complete Task 86 First
- Adds PayPal payment option
- Takes 2-8h estimated
- Would bring us to 97/100
- Still leaves 3 AI image tasks

### Option C: Wait for Resources
- Dell GPU comes online for Tasks 51-52
- Choose AI upscaling service for Task 54
- Then batch-complete all 4 tasks together

## 💡 STRATEGIC DECISION NEEDED

**Question for David/Opus:**
Should we:
1. **SHIP NOW** at 96% and iterate based on feedback?
2. **ADD PAYPAL** first (Task 86) → 97%?
3. **WAIT** for Dell/AI resources to complete all 4 together → 100%?
